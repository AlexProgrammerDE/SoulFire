// ScriptService provides management capabilities for automation scripts within SoulFire.
//
// STATUS: This service is currently DISABLED while a visual node-based script editor
// is under development. The service definition is preserved as a placeholder for the
// future implementation.
//
// HISTORY: This service previously supported JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript scripts
// that could be scoped either globally (affecting all instances) or per-instance.
// The text-based scripting system (using GraalVM Polyglot) was removed in favor of
// an upcoming visual script editor that will provide a more user-friendly,
// node-based approach to automation.
//
// PLANNED FUNCTIONALITY: When re-implemented, this service will likely provide:
// - Script creation, deletion, and modification through a visual editor
// - Script execution scoped to global or instance levels
// - Script lifecycle management (start, stop, restart)
// - Script listing and metadata retrieval
// - Integration with the logging system via InstanceScriptLogScope (see logs.proto)
//
// PERMISSIONS: Script-related permissions have been reserved in common.proto:
// - GlobalPermission fields 18-22 are reserved for global script permissions
// - InstancePermission fields 16-20 are reserved for instance script permissions
//
// LOGGING: Script execution logs can be filtered using InstanceScriptLogScope
// defined in logs.proto, which requires both an instance_id and script_id.
