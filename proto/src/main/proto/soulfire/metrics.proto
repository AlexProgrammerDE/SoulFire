// MetricsService - Instance Metrics and Monitoring Service
// ============================================================================
//
// The MetricsService provides real-time metrics and monitoring data for
// SoulFire instances. It enables clients to:
//
// - View time-series metrics (bot counts, network traffic, tick duration, etc.)
// - View current-state distributions (health histograms, dimension counts, etc.)
// - Track bot positions on an XZ scatter plot
//
// Metrics are collected server-side and stored in a ring buffer, ensuring
// consistent data across multiple clients. Snapshots are sampled every 3 seconds.
// ============================================================================
